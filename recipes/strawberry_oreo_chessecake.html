            <h2>Description</h2>
            
            <p>
                This strawberry Oreo cheesecake is what dreams are made of!<br>
                A decadent, smooth, creamy filling sits atop a dark, chocolaty Oreo cookie crust<br>
                and gets punctuated with bright notes of sweet-tart strawberries.<br>
                Give yourself plenty of time to make this—it requires at least 8 hours of chill time.<br>
            </p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Strawberry sauce: Place strawberries, sugar, lemon juice, and salt in a small saucepan over medium-low heat.<br>
                        Cook, stirring often, until strawberries soften and release their juices, about 10 minutes.<br>
                        Use a potato masher to mash strawberries.<br>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Stir water and cornstarch together in a small bowl.<br>
                        Add cornstarch mixture to strawberries, and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture begins to thicken, 1 to 2 minutes more.<br>
                        Remove from heat, and carefully pour mixture through a fine mesh sieve set over a bowl;<br>
                        use the back of a wooden spoon or spatula to press out as much juice as possible.<br>
                        Discard pulp. Place strawberry sauce, uncovered, into the refrigerator to cool.<br>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan.<br>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Oreo crust: Combine cookie crumbs, brown sugar, and salt.<br>
                        Stir in melted butter until thoroughly combined.<br>
                        Press mixture evenly into the bottom and 1 inch up the sides of the prepared pan.<br>
                        Place pan on a rimmed baking sheet.<br>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Bake crust in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.<br>
                        Remove from the oven, leaving oven on, and allow to cool for 10 minutes.<br>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Cheesecake filling: Beat cream cheese and sugar until thoroughly smooth and combined.<br>
                        Add in heavy cream, lemon juice, vanilla extract, salt, almond extract, and nutmeg; beat on low speed until smooth.<br>
                        Add in eggs, and beat on low speed just until eggs are incorporated.<br>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Pour half of filling into crust.<br>
                        Drizzle 6 tablespoons of cooled strawberry sauce over filling.<br>
                        Pour remaining filling into the pan, taking care to cover strawberry sauce.<br>
                        Reserve remaining strawberry sauce, covered, in the refrigerator until ready to serve the cheesecake.<br>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Return cheesecake to the oven and bake until the top looks set,<br>
                        and edges are beginning to turn golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes.<br>
                        Turn oven off, prop the door slightly ajar, and leave cheesecake to cool in the oven for 1 hour.<br>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Remove cheesecake to a wire rack.<br>
                        Run a knife around the top edge of cheesecake to loosen it slightly from the pan;<br>
                        allow to cool in the pan to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours.<br>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        When ready to serve, toss halved strawberries into reserved strawberry sauce until thoroughly coated.<br>
                        Remove cheesecake from springform pan; place on a serving platter.<br>
                        Pour strawberries and sauce on top of the cake, and turn all the berries cut-side-down.<br>
                        Garnish with halved Oreos, if desired. Keep extra cheesecake stored in the fridge.<br>
